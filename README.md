## Introduction

In this project, we focus on testing key components of a Spring Boot application:

- **JUnit** for basic unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
- **Mockito** to mock dependencies in the service layer, ensuring tests are isolated.
- **MockMvc** to test Spring MVC controllers in isolation from the web layer, simulating HTTP requests and verifying responses.

This setup ensures high test coverage, making your application more reliable and easier to maintain.
